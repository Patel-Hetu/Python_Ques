CPS 109 
Lab 4

Ques 1:

'''Write a program that uses a loop to computer the sum of all the even numbers from 2
to 100 inclusive.'''

x = 0

for i in range(2,100+1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        x = x + i
print (x)


Ques 2:

'''Write a program with a loop to compute the sum of all the squares from 1 to 100
inclusive'''

x = 0

for i in range(1,100+1):
    if i**2 <= 100:
        x = i**2 + x
print(x)


Ques 3:

'''Write a program with a loop to compute and print the powers of 2, for powers 0 to 20
inclusive.'''

x = 0

for i in range(0,20+1):
    print(2**i)


Ques 4:

'''Write a program with a loop to compute the sum of all the odd numbers from a to b
inclusive, where a and b are inputs from the user.'''

a = int(input("Enter the First Number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the Second Number: "))

x = 0

for i in range(a,b+1):
    if i%2 == 1:
        x = x + i
print (x)


Ques 5:

'''Write a program with a loop to compute the sum of all odd digits of an input. For
example, if the input is 32677, the sum would be 3 + 7 + 7 = 17'''


num = input('Enter a value: ')

s = 0

for digit in  num:
    d = int(digit)
    if d % 2 == 1:
        s += d
print('Sum of all odd digits of the entered value is', s)


Ques 6:

'''Ask the user to input 10 integers, and then the program prints the largest odd number
that was entered. For example of the integers were: 10, 9, 7, 12, 2, 5, 15, 100, 90, 60,
then the program would print 15 as the largest odd number. If there is no odd number,
then the program should print a message saying so.’’'

    print ('There are no odd numbers.')
else: 
    print (max, 'is the largest odd integer.’)


Ques 7:

'''Write a program which reads a string containing any characters from the user and prints
the sum of the digits in the string. For example, if the string from the user is "I want 3
oranges and 24 bananas, 1abc.", then the output would be 10, since 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 10.
Note that a character is a digit if it is greater than or equal to '0' and less than or equal
to '9'.'''


strg = input('Enter a sentence containing words and numbers: ')

sum = 0

for char in strg:
    if char.isdigit():
        sum = sum + int(char)
print(sum)


Ques 8:

'''Similar to Q7, from the text, read a string from the user which is a sequence of decimal
numbers separated by commas, e.g., "1.23,2.4,3.123". Print the sum of the numbers,
which for this example is the sum of 1.23 + 2.4 + 3.123 = 6.753'''


strg = input('Enter a string: ')

x = strg.split(',')

sum = sum([float(num) for num in x])

print(sum)
